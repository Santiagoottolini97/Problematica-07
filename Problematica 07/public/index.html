          ceremony in April will be an intimate, in-person gathering, held
          without Zoom and limited to nominees, presenters and their guests, the
          producers said on Thursday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the coronavirus pandemic, events to hand out the highest
          honours in the film industry will held at both the Union Station in
          downtown Los Angeles and the traditional home of the Academy Awards at
          the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.
        </p>
        <p>
          All attendees will be tested and there will be a Covid-19 safety team
          on site throughout the evening on 25 April.
        </p>
        <p>
          “There will not be an option to Zoom in for the show,” producers
          Steven Soderbergh, Jesse Collins and Stacey Sher said in note to the
          more than 200 nominees this year.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We are going to great lengths to provide a safe and ENJOYABLE evening
          for all of you in person, as well as for all the millions of film fans
          around the world, and we feel the virtual thing will diminish those
          efforts.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The producers said nominees and their guests would gather at a
          courtyard in the Union rail station, while other show elements would
          be held live inside the Dolby Theatre about 13km (8 miles) away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, hundreds of the world’s top movie stars would gather in the
          3,400-seat theatre for a live show preceded by a red carpet packed
          with photographers and camera crews.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other awards shows in recent months have replaced the usual gatherings
          at gala dinners and on stage with pre-recorded appearances or virtual
          events or a combination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Television audiences have slumped, with the Golden Globes and the
          Grammys attracting the smallest numbers in decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nominations for the Oscars were announced on Monday, with 1930s
          Hollywood drama Mank leading the field with 10, followed by The
          Father, Black Panther story Judas and the Black Messiah,
          Korean-language drama Minari, Nomadland, MeToo revenge tale Promising
          Young Woman, Amazon Studio drama Sound of Metal, and 1960s Vietnam war
          courtroom drama The Trial of the Chicago 7.

          ... as you join us today from Argentina, we have a small favour to
          ask. Through these turbulent and challenging times, millions rely on
          the Guardian for independent journalism that stands for truth and
          integrity. Readers chose to support us financially more than 1.5
          million times in 2020, joining existing supporters in 180 countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          For 2021, we commit to another year of high-impact reporting that can
          counter misinformation and offer an authoritative, trustworthy source
          of news for everyone. With no shareholders or billionaire owner, we
          set our own agenda and provide truth-seeking journalism that’s free
          from commercial and political influence. When it’s never mattered
          more, we can investigate and challenge without fear or favour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike many others, we have maintained our choice: to keep Guardian
          journalism open for all readers, regardless of where they live or what
          they can afford to pay. We do this because we believe in information
          equality, where everyone deserves to read accurate news and thoughtful
          analysis. Greater numbers of people are staying well-informed on world
          events, and being inspired to take meaningful action.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last year alone, we offered readers a comprehensive,
          international perspective on critical events – from the Black Lives
          Matter protests, to the US presidential election, Brexit, and the
          ongoing pandemic. We enhanced our reputation for urgent, powerful
          reporting on the climate emergency, and made the decision to reject
          advertising from fossil fuel companies, divest from the oil and gas
          industries, and set a course to achieve net zero emissions by 2030.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there were ever a time to join us, it is now. You can power
          Guardian journalism and help sustain our future.
